Sanapuuro
=========

This game has been inspired by Scrabble but has some distinguishing features. The idea of the game is to place letters in to a grid to form words either horizontally or vertically. Words can also go from right to left and down to up. You compete against time raising your score with each correct word submission.

At the moment the game has the bare basics of being able to place and select letters and submit words. There is also a countdown timer giving you 5 minutes to submit words. The game starts immediately upon executing the jar file.

Controls:
<ul>
<li>WSAD keys for moving the grid cursor up, down, left and right.</li>
<li>Left mouse button for selecting a letter in the grid or placing a letter from the letter pool into the grid.</li>
<li>Right mouse button for clearing a letter selection or returning a letter back to the pool (can be clicked anywhere).</li>
<li>Space for submitting a word.</li>
</ul>
