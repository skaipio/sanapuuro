Sanapuuro
=========

This game has been inspired by Scrabble but has some distinguishing features. The idea of the game is to place letters in to a grid to form words either horizontally or vertically. Words can also go from right to left and down to up. Note that letters previously placed in the grid can be used again for forming a word but at least one letter from the letter pool has to be placed for an acceptable submission.  You compete against time raising your score with each correct word submission.

At the moment the game has the bare basics of being able to place and select letters and submit words. There is also a countdown timer giving you a 2 minute head start to submit words. You get more time by submitting words correctly. Longer words give more time per submitted letter. The game starts immediately upon executing the jar file.
